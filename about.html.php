              <p>Using their jewelry-loving energy, Marijke and Crashy started Z&amp;Z by merging Fifth Avenue quality with affordable 47th Street prices. As a word of mouth business, with low overhead, they became known for quality, value and customer service. From diamond engagement rings and unique charm bracelets, to diamond solitaire necklaces, and custom designed projects, Z&amp;Z’s jewelry has become a well-known name in the jewelry world.</p>

              <p>Marijke was born into a Dutch “diamond family”, her father spent his career as a diamond dealer and jewelry manufacturer, while her mother was a diamond cutter. After receiving gemology degrees in Germany and England, Marijke completed a jewelry management course in Switzerland, worked in a diamond-grading lab and as an appraiser, at an auction house, where she met the estate jeweler, who invited her to work for him in New York City.</p>
              <p>After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1982, Crashy went to the Gemological Institute of America in New York City to begin her career. She worked for a stone dealer, jewelry manufacturer, and two diamond dealers before starting Z&amp;Z with Marijke.</p>
              <p>&quot;She absolutely LOVES the ring, all the credit goes to you. It is so beautiful and it fits too! We are so so happy! Yesterday was the most wonderful day, thanks for making it so special!&quot;</p>
